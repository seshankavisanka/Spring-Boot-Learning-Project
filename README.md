# Family Cash Card Application with Spring Boot

## Introduction

Welcome to the Family Cash Card application built using Spring Boot! This is a project developed as part of the "Building a REST API with Spring Boot" course, designed for Java developers to learn and understand the fundamentals of Spring Boot.

The primary goal of this project is to create a cloud-based application that allows parents to manage allowances for their kids in a virtual "cash card" format. Instead of dealing with physical cash, parents can now easily send, receive, track, edit, and delete allowances for their children through this secure RESTful API.

## My Spring Boot Learning Journey

I started learning Spring Boot with a desire to enhance my Java skills and explore modern frameworks for building robust applications. This project is a result of my journey through the "Building a REST API with Spring Boot" course, where I learned the following:

- Understanding the benefits and trade-offs of RESTful APIs.
- Leveraging Spring Boot's features for application development and comparing them with the Spring Framework.
- Building web applications using Spring Web.
- Using Spring Data to connect databases and map relational data to Java objects.
- Implementing a Security First approach with Spring Security.

Throughout this course, I adopted a Test-First approach, which allowed me to gain confidence in my code's correctness and understand the importance of writing comprehensive tests.+

## Functionality

The Family Cash Card application comes with the following features:

1. Create a new cash card in the database.
2. View the details of a cash card.
3. Edit the information of an existing cash card.
4. Delete a cash card.
5. Secure endpoints to prevent unauthorized access.

## Technologies Used

The application utilizes the following technologies:

- Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building Java-based applications.
- Spring Web: Enables building web applications with Spring.
- Spring Data: Facilitates connecting databases and mapping data to Java objects.
- Spring Security: Provides security features for the application.
